	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<div id="about_text">
		</br>
		ENVY Eyewear was founded in 2001, in the Beaches section of Eastern Toronto. Our desire for a personal lifestyle changes led us to discover the Collingwood region. 
		After spending much time in the region, a relocation process ensued and eventually we set up shop in the Village at Blue. 
		Although we are situated in a resort setting, our pricing remains competitive without reflecting a resort premium on our product.
		</br>
		</br>
		Owner, Armand Attar, opened ENVY Eyewear after an impressive 30 years of wholesale experience in the optics industry. Travel enables Armand to bring together some of the finest collections of high fashion, lifestyle eyeweat from around the globe. 
		</br></br>
		We extend an invitation for you to visit us personally when you are spending time in our vacation playgrounf. Browse our diverse selection of designer, lifestyle eyewear and experience our personal approach for yourself.
		</br></br>
		When you introduce yourself, we will make you feel welcome. Mention you have seen us online and receive a token of our appreciation!
